    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Sinigang is a Filipino sour soup known for its distinctive tangy flavor, typically achieved through the use of tamarind as 
        a souring agent. It features a variety of ingredients such as pork, shrimp, or beef, along with a mix of vegetables like water spinach, 
        radish, and eggplant, creating a comforting and flavorful dish.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Radish</li>
        <li>String Beans</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>To prepare Sinigang, start by boiling about 8 cups of water in a pot, then add your chosen protein—whether it's pork ribs, pork belly, 
            beef shank, or shrimp—and let it simmer until the meat is partially cooked.</p></li>
        <li><p>Introduce sliced radish and green beans, allowing them to soften, followed by eggplant, leafy vegetables like kangkong or spinach, and green 
            chili peppers if desired. Dissolve 2-3 tablespoons of tamarind paste or use a tamarind Sinigang mix in the broth, season with 2-3 tablespoons of fish sauce 
            (Patis), and add salt and pepper to taste.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finish by incorporating sliced onions and simmering until all the ingredients are tender, creating the distinctive tangy and savory Sinigang soup. Adjust the seasoning as 
            needed before serving over rice.</p></li>
    </ol>
