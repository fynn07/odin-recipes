        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Sisig is a Filipino dish renowned for its savory, spicy, and often tangy flavors. It typically consists of chopped and grilled pig's 
            face parts, such as ears, snout, and cheeks, seasoned with calamansi (Filipino lime), vinegar, soy sauce, and various spices. Sisig is 
            often served on a sizzling hot plate, creating a crispy texture on the edges and a rich, flavorful experience. Variations of sisig may include 
            other meats like chicken or fish for those who prefer alternatives to pork.</p>
